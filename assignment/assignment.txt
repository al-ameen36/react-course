** Question 1 **

Add 4 new features to our banking app
- Copy our banking logic to a new file
- Add a feature and describe it
- Write the descriptions as comments in your code

Example features to add
- Check balance
- Buy utility (meter no, meter owners name ....)

Note: 
- Use string concatenation to give the user feedback after every action
- Comment are not considered code (by javascript), so they are not executed
- Comments lines start with "//" 

e.g 
// this is a sample comment
